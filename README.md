# Dapr Unleashed: Accelerating Microservice Development in .NET

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for "Dapr Unleashed: Accelerating Microservice Development in .NET." This repository serves as a companion to my lecture at Sinergija23 and is designed to demonstrate the practical benefits of integrating Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) into a .NET microservices architecture. Here is the link to my lecture: https://sinergija.live/en/2023/lectures/370/rapid-development-with-dapr

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main branches:

1. **`main`**: Contains the .NET application without Dapr integration. This branch serves as a baseline to demonstrate typical microservice development scenarios.
   
2. **`dapr`**: Features the same .NET application, but enhanced with Dapr. This branch illustrates the advantages and improvements Dapr brings to microservice development, particularly in terms of reduction of source code, confiv over source code, and ease of development.

## Getting Started

To get started with this demo:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/janeski/dapr-unleashed.git


2. Navigate to the repository directory:

cd dapr-unleashed


### Running the Application Without Dapr

To run the application without Dapr:

1. Switch to the `develop` branch:

git checkout develop

2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` within this branch for setup and running the application.

### Running the Application With Dapr

To experience the application with Dapr integration:

1. Switch to the `dapr` branch:


2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` within this branch for setting up Dapr and running the application.
